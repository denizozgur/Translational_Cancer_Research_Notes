    "* Cancer is caused by agents that alter or mutate DNA, known as carcinogens. These mutations, which can range from small changes in a single DNA base to large chromosomal changes, accumulate over time. As we age, the chance of developing cancer increases because our DNA has more time to collect these mutations. This is why cancer is more common in older people and has become more prevalent as human lifespans have increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most mutations found in tumor cells are somatic, meaning they occur in body cells and are not inherited, but they are passed to daughter cells during cell division. This makes cancer a genetic disease at the cellular level. Only mutations in sperm or egg cells, called germ-line mutations, can be passed to offspring, but these rarely cause cancer directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As cancer cells accumulate mutations, they continue to evolve, gaining a growth advantage over neighboring cells. This process mirrors Darwinian evolution, where random mutations lead to survival of the fittest cells, making cancer progression a natural and statistically inevitable outcome.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Mutations accumulate in cells only when the cell’s defense mechanisms, such as DNA repair, fail. If DNA damage isn't repaired before the next cell division, it gets passed to daughter cells. Cells have several ways to repair DNA, and in severe cases, they trigger cell suicide to protect the body from transformation into cancerous cells. However, when these defense systems are overwhelmed, cells with harmful mutations can slip through.\n",
